# Resource Recommendations for Cloud Certification Exams

## AWS Cloud Practitioner

The practitioner is mostly aimed at new-to-cloud and non-technical roles, such as sales people to get them to know what AWS offers. The real stuff starts with Solutions Architect, which I'll also be going for later!

The exam was not that bad, and knowledge of the services can be on a surface level, like knowing S3, its tiers, and cost/performance advantages for each tier. Along with services, the AWS Well-Architectured Framework and Cloud Adoption Framework were covered.

Resource Recommendations:
- https://aws.training/ - official aws live classroom sessions covering exam topics, with an extra exam prep session. Theres also a 20-question mock exam available to try. I didn't use their 3-part series, and relied on the next resource
- https://youtu.be/JsmhEgIV1mQ - loved this video because he goes through the essential services and indicates when you should take breaks (pomodoro)
- https://aws.amazon.com/ - the official service documentation website. I use it to get a quick idea for what a service is/does and its use cases. sometimes the tagline is enough to know what the service is, i.e. the AWS Lightsail page (https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/)
- And finally youtube videos going over past questions.
